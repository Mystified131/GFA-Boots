A python program created to help users to find impartial, non-partisan audio, and to avoid 'Fake News" sites-- this is the web app. version. This program allows you to enter up to two search terms. One function allows users to retrieve and play audio based on these terms, regardless of network or affiliation. Another option provides links to topical searches from the major 5 U.S. News Networks. The author of the code has no affiliation with any of these networks, and is not trying to advance a particular perspective.
